# Data Analysis in Various Domains â€“ Summer Internship 2025  

This repository contains the work I completed during my **Summer Internship 2025** at **Samatrix Consulting Pvt. Ltd.** under the guidance of **Prof. Nishant Koshti** and **Mr. Prajyot Tugaonkar**.  
The internship focused on applying **statistical and computational techniques** to solve problems across diverse domains such as finance, marketing, healthcare, operations, manufacturing, sports, and politics.

##  Projects Included  

1. **1 Day Value at Risk (VaR)**  
   - Estimated potential one-day financial losses for a stock portfolio using **parametric and historical methods**.  
   - Tools: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `yfinance`  

2. **A/B Testing**  
   - Simulated and analyzed conversion rates for two variants (A & B).  
   - Result: Variant B significantly outperformed Variant A with a **2.33% lift**.  

3. **Call Centre Operation Simulation**  
   - Modeled staffing and customer wait times using **queueing theory (M/M/s model)**.  
   - Explored the trade-off between **cost and service quality**.  

4. **Clinical Trial Survival Analysis**  
   - Used **Kaplan-Meier estimation, log-rank tests, and Cox models** to evaluate treatment effects and covariates.  
   - Tools: `lifelines`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  

5. **Manufacturing Quality Control**  
   - Monitored defect rates using **control charts (P-chart, CUSUM, EWMA)**.  
   - Detected process shift from **5% to 8% defects**.  

6. **IPL Data Analysis**  
   - Analyzed match data to compare performance between **league and playoff matches**.  
   - Applied statistical tests (`Shapiro-Wilk`, `Mann-Whitney U`).  

7. **Election Statistics**  
   - Explored **candidate participation, gender distribution, and voter turnout trends**.  
   - Found female candidates had a **higher win rate (12.47%)** compared to males (7.95%).
